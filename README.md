# BinaryTicTacToe
I call this Binary Tic Tac Toe because it runs a bit-wise & comparison on the selected move against the possible win combinations
both result in a 1 then the move is a winning move. This same logic is also used for the AI which will make a move based on it's ability
to block it's opponent from making a move (similar to a greedy algorithm); however, at this point the AI makes this a priority over going
for an winning a move. So in future versions I will fix this defect in the AI but keep the current AI as an option for and "easy" mode.
